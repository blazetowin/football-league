# ⚽ Go Football League Simulator

A full-featured football league simulation backend built with Go and SQLite.
This project supports both CLI-based and REST API-based interaction for simulating matches, managing fixtures, viewing league tables, and generating championship predictions.

---

## 📌 Overview

* Simulates a 4-team league over 6 weeks (home and away)
* Team powers affect match scores (editable)
* Auto-generates fixtures with home/away balance
* View week-by-week progress in CLI or via HTTP endpoints
* SQLite database with schema auto-loaded on start
* Easily reset and customize league structure and results

## ⚙️ Running the Project

### 🔹 Option 1: CLI Simulation

Simulates each week step-by-step in terminal.

```bash
go run main.go
```

* Press `Enter` to go to the next week
* After Week 4, title predictions are printed below the table
* Match results and league table are printed every week

---

### 🔹 Option 2: REST API Server

Launches HTTP server with API endpoints.

```bash
go run ./cmd/server.go
```

Server runs at: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## 🔁 Database Reset / Customization

* Delete existing database:

  ```bash
  rm league.db
  ```
* Edit team powers in:
  `internal/migration/schema.sql` → bottom section
* Schema and initial data are auto-applied at startup

---

## ⚽ Fixture Generation Logic

* Automatically generates 6-week fixtures using `CreateFixture()`
* Each team plays 3 home + 3 away matches
* You can adjust scoring advantage logic in `match.go` (line 70–71)
